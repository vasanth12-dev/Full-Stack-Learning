<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a hardworking engineering student specializing in Artificial Intelligence, with a strong focus on front-end development\.
   I have experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, and Figma, and I am currently working on a MERN stack-based campus maintenance system with role-based access 
   and email notifications. I am passionate about problem-solving and competitive programming, actively practicing DSA and SQL for placements on platforms like LeetCode. 
   I have participated in paper presentations and served as an event coordinator for Glitch Hunt (error debugging) at Infefix 24. Additionally, I have competed in zonal-level chess. 
   While I am well-versed in Git and GitHub, I am still exploring deployment workflows. I prefer direct, optimized solutions and enjoy structured debugging and problem-solving approaches.</p>
